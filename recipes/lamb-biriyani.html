    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a bit of a project and is time-consuming, but I have never been disappointed with the results. Since it is such a festive dish, I usually make it for dinner parties. It is a huge hit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Â½ cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
        <li>Plain old Biriyani Spices</li>
        <li>4 large onions, sliced thin</li>
        <li>Ginger garlic paste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>Lamb chops</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>Green chillies</li>
        <li>yogurt</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place the basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30 minutes. Drain.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the garlic paste and ginger paste into the onion mixture; cook until the garlic and ginger is fragrant, about 1 minute more. Sprinkle the cilantro and mint over the mixture and cook 1 minute more.

        </p></li>
        <li><p>Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir the lamb until the meat begins to brown, about 20 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir the tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper into the mixture; continue cooking until the oil begins to separate from the gravy, about 10 minutes. Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add water as needed to keep the mixture from getting too dry.

        </p></li>
        <li><p>Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice is nearly done yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet; fry the sliced onion in the hot oil until lightly browned.</p></li>
        <li><p>Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala over the rice. Spread the fried onion over the lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Stir the saffron and warm milk together in a small bowl; pour over the top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.</p></li>
    </ol>
